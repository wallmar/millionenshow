# Millionenshow
A funny quizapp designed for a birthday party

## Commands
* `npm install` to install all dependencies
* `npm run build` to build for production
* `npm run start` to start development-server at [localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080)

## Adaptions
* Questions can be changed in __config/game.json__
* Prices can be changed in __index.html__

## Notes
When the user is playing for the last price, the last question is automatically displayed (thus, the "reserve"-questions will be skipped). But the right answer will not be clickable ==> more fun ;)
